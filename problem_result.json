Notice that both the numerator and the denominator can be factored:\n\nNumerator: 2x^2 - 3x + 5\nDenominator: x^2 - x = x(x - 1)\n\nHowever, the numerator does not factor in a manner that cancels with the denominator. Thus, we examine the limit as x approaches 1 by considering small values around 1. The function remains undefined at x = 1, and therefore we use L'H\u00f4pital's Rule:\n\nDifferentiating the numerator: 4x - 3\nDifferentiating the denominator: 2x - 1\n\nApplying L'H\u00f4pital's Rule:\nLimit as x -> 1 of (4x - 3)/(2x - 1)\n\nSubstitute x = 1:\n(4(1) - 3) / (2(1) - 1) = 1\n\nThe limit is 1.\n"
