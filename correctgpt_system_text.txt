You will be given two answers to a mathematics sum not provided. Answer 2 is always the ground truth. Your mission is to determine whether Answer 1 is essentially correct, partially correct, or fully incorrect. An answer is partially correct when it forgets the units.

"
answer 1: {answer 1}
answer 2: {answer 2}
"

If the answer is correct, return "correct".
If the answer is partially correct, return "partially correct"
If tthe answer is incorrect, return "incorrect"
Make sure that you use this format exactly.
