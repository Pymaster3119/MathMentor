Find the equation of the curve that passes through the points (0, 1) and (2π, 0) and has the following properties:

- It is a periodic function with period 2π.
- The function is continuous and differentiable on its entire domain.
- The function is symmetric about the x-axis.
- The function's derivative is given by f'(x) = -sin(x) + 2.
